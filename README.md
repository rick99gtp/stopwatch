# stopwatch
This is a simple project to test my javascript skills.  This starts a timer and displays the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds on screen. I added colored lines as a bonus to show graphically the progress of the timer.

Tech stack:

I used HTML, CSS (SASS), and Javascript for this project.
